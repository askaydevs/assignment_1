90,1078,Sweet flattering dress,"I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets!","{'dress': ['cute', 'perfect'], 'foot': ['curvy'], 'it': ['made', 'difficult', 'especially'], 'that': ['flattering']}"

508,1078,"Comfy, cute, and colorful.","This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.","{'dress': ['knit', 'comfortable'], 'color': ['various'], 'issue': ['only'], 'fabric': ['sturdy'], 'sleeve': ['long'], 'skirt': ['longer'], 'stripe': ['horizontal']}"
